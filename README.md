Hello welcome to my quiz game. Click the button to start the game. Select your answer and see if you are right or wrong but dont wait to long or you will miss your chance to make a guess at all. The game itself is broken up into a handful of functions. The setup function has most of the game logic in it. The timer I took from a example we did in class. The const I used was something I googled as another way to loop through my object. The rest of game is built off stuff I did in the previous games I made. The hardest part of this was creating the last question and making it work the way its supposed to. It took slightly different logic and that took me some time to figure out. All the questions have the same logic it looks at the id of the div you clicked on if the id of the div equals correct then you run certain code otherwise you run other code. After each guess an overall game index goes up by one which is what allows you to access the next question and and anwsers and append them to the page. The last question doesnt work like that because all 4 anwsers are correct. It took asking for some help and a slight mindset change to get that final question working. I found saying once overall game index is the same as the last index of the quiz array then no matter what the user guesses run the correct guess code. By makeing the quiz array have objects in it saved me a step from my fighting game project. Looking back at this code now i can see i could have made a few more functions such as winning and lossing functions to cut down on how long the code is. There are 3 endings one where you get more right then anything else one where you get more wrong then anything else and one where you just dont guess more then anything else.
