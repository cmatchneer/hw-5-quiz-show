# hw-5-quiz-show
Hello welcome to my quiz game. Click the button to start the game.
the game itself is broken up into a handful of functions. The setup
function has most of the game logic in it. The timer I took from 
a example we did in class. The const I used was something I googled. The 
rest of game is built off stuff I did in the previous games I made. There are 3 endings
one where you get more right then anything else one where you get more wrong then
anything else and one where you just dont guess more then anything else.
